# HIT_Advanced_Programming_Workshop_FInal_Project
A game I created for my B.Sc. in computer science bachelor's degree.
It's a D&D style game with all random dice toss, damage, armour and more.
I also add a UI with a lot of visual background and sound effects.
There are also options to save the current game and load previous saves, as well as a high score leaderboard.
(of course, there is an easter egg in the game)
